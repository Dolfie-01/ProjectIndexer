# System Patterns

## ProjectIndexer Architecture Patterns

### File Processing Pipeline

- **Pattern**: Sequential processing pipeline
- **Components**: Scanner → Indexer → Search Engine
- **Characteristics**:
  - Each component has single responsibility
  - Data flows linearly between components
  - Easy to add new processing steps

### Indexing Strategy

- **Pattern**: Inverted index
- **Characteristics**:
  - Efficient for text search
  - Scales well with document count
  - Supports partial matches

### Error Handling

- **Pattern**: Fail-fast with recovery
- **Characteristics**:
  - Validate inputs early
  - Log detailed errors
  - Continue processing other files if one fails

### Language Handling Strategy

- **Pattern**: Strategy Pattern (Recommended)
- **Context**: The system needs to parse and index files from multiple programming languages (Python, C#, Java, JavaScript), each requiring specific logic.
- **Solution**: Define a common interface for language processors (parsers/indexers). Implement concrete strategies for each supported language. A central orchestrator or factory selects the appropriate strategy based on file type or language detection.
- **Characteristics**:
  - Encapsulates language-specific logic.
  - Easily extensible to support new languages without modifying core components.
  - Promotes separation of concerns.
